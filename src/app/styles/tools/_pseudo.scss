$focusable-class: "o-focusable";
/// A selector target for elements that users can focus.
///
/// This is essentially a placeholder with no styles. Typically
/// you'd apply this to the container block, and then use it
/// within a child component, when selecting child elements for styling with
/// :focus or :focus-within.
///
/// This class is necessary because you can only apply the tabindex propery
/// where it makes sense (typically the container block). Composition can get
/// in the way by separating the block container from its child, making it
/// less reliable for children to select the container block.
///
/// In short, it's a conventient and standardised way to target the container block.
///
/// @param {string} $pseudo-class - psuedo/psuedo-within (exclude the colon).
/// @content any styles you wish to become active when the focusable element is focused.
/// @output the class .o-focusable:focus[-within], with whatever styles you include via
/// content.
